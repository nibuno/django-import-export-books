  "content": "django-import-export is open-source and, as such, grows (or shrinks) & improves in part due to the community. Below are some guidelines on how to help with the project.\n\nBy contributing you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct.\n\ndjango-import-export is BSD-licensed. All contributed code must be either\n\nthe original work of the author, contributed under the BSD, or…\n\nwork taken from another project released under a BSD-compatible license.\n\nGPL’d (or similar) works are not eligible for inclusion.\n\ndjango-import-export’s git main branch should always be stable, production-ready & passing all tests.\n\nPlease check the common issues section of the FAQ to see if your question already has an answer.\n\nFor general questions about usage, we recommend posting to Stack Overflow, using the django-import-export tag. Please search existing answers to see if any match your problem. If not, post a new question including as much relevant detail as you can. See how to ask for more details.\n\nFor questions about the internals of the library, please raise an issue and use the ‘question’ workflow.\n\nFirst check to see if there is an existing issue which answers your question.\n\nRemember to include as much detail as you can so that your question is answered in a timely manner.\n\nSo you’ve found a bug or have a great idea for a feature. Here are the steps you should take to help get it added/fixed in django-import-export:\n\nFirst, check to see if there’s an existing issue or pull request for the bug/feature.\n\nIf there isn’t one there, please file an issue. The ideal report includes:\n\nA description of the problem/suggestion.\n\nHow to recreate the bug.\n\nIf relevant, including the versions of your:\n\nOptionally any of the other dependencies involved\n\nIdeally, creating a pull request with a (failing) test case demonstrating what’s wrong. This makes it easy for us to reproduce and fix the problem.\n\nIf you’re ready to take the plunge and contribute back some code or documentation please consider the following:\n\nSearch existing issues and PRs to see if there are already any similar proposals.\n\nFor substantial changes, we recommend raising a question first so that we can offer any advice or pointers based on previous experience.\n\nThe process should look like:\n\nFork the project on GitHub into your own account.\n\nClone your copy of django-import-export.\n\nMake a new branch in git & commit your changes there.\n\nPush your new branch up to GitHub.\n\nAgain, ensure there isn’t already an issue or pull request out there on it.\n\nIf there is and you feel you have a better fix, please take note of the issue number and mention it in your pull request.\n\nCreate a new pull request (based on your branch), including what the problem/feature is, versions of your software and referencing any related issues/pull requests.\n\nWe recommend setting up your editor to automatically indicate non-conforming styles (see Development).\n\nIn order to be merged into django-import-export, contributions must have the following:\n\nworks across all supported versions of Python/Django.\n\nfollows the existing style of the code base (mostly PEP-8).\n\ncomments included as needed to explain why the code functions as it does\n\nA test case that demonstrates the previous flaw that now passes with the included patch.\n\nIf it adds/changes a public API, it must also include documentation for those changes.\n\nMust be appropriately licensed (see Philosophy).\n\nAdds yourself to the AUTHORS file.\n\nIf your contribution lacks any of these things, they will have to be added by a core contributor before being merged into django-import-export proper, which may take substantial time for the all-volunteer team to get to.\n\nAll files should be formatted using the black auto-formatter. This will be run by pre-commit if configured.\n\nThe project repository includes an .editorconfig file. We recommend using a text editor with EditorConfig support to avoid indentation and whitespace issues.\n\nWe allow up to 88 characters as this is the line length used by black. This check is included when you run flake8. Documentation, comments, and docstrings should be wrapped at 79 characters, even though PEP 8 suggests 72.\n\nTo install pre-commit:\n\nIf using git blame, you can ignore commits which made large changes to the code base, such as reformatting. Run this command from the base project directory:\n\nOnce you have cloned and checked out the repository, you can install a new development environment as follows:\n\nYou can run the test suite with:\n\nTo build a local version of the documentation:\n\nThe documentation will be present in docs/_build/html/index.html.\n\nWhen generating or updating translation files with makemessages, use the make messages command. This command adds the –add-location=file arg to include only the source file path, not line numbers.\n\nThis keeps .po files cleaner and avoids unnecessary version control churn when line numbers shift due to unrelated code changes.\n\nTranslators can still trace strings back to their source using the file references.",
