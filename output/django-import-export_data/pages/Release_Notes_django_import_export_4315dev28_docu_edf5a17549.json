  "content": "This release fixes an issue with form field name clashes (see 2108).\n\nIf you have any customizations which rely on form field names then you may need to make some adjustments as a result of this change.\n\nThe resource, format and export_items field names are now prepended with django-import-export-.\n\nRemoved the deprecated get_valid_export_item_pks() method in favour of get_queryset(). Use the ModelAdmin’s get_queryset() or get_export_queryset() instead.\n\nFixed issue where export forms were incorrectly showing import fields instead of export fields. This was resolved by introducing context-specific methods for field retrieval. See deprecations and PR 2118.\n\nThe get_user_visible_fields() method is now deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0. Use get_user_visible_import_fields() for import contexts and get_user_visible_export_fields() for export contexts instead. This change ensures that import and export operations show their respective field sets correctly in admin forms.\n\nWhen exporting via admin action, the queryset is now filtered on get_queryset() instead of the Model’s default queryset. This should have no impact on existing implementations.\n\nThis change also made get_valid_export_item_pks() obsolete, as the ModelAdmin’s get_export_queryset(), or ModelAdmin’s get_queryset can be used instead. The get_valid_export_item_pks() method is now deprecated.\n\nRemoved internal method _get_enabled_export_fields() in favour of passing the selected fields list as a new parameter to export_resource() and get_export_headers().\n\nHide the “Resource” form when it only has one option, to avoid potentially confusing text in the interface like “Resource: BookResource”. To undo this change, use a form subclass that changes the field’s widget to a django.forms.Select. See 1908\n\ntablib has been upgraded from v3.5.0 to 3.6.1. This upgrade removes tablib’s dependency on MarkupPy in favour of ElementTree. If you export to HTML, then this change may affect your output format, particularly if you have already escaped HTML characters in the text.\n\nThis release fixes a regression introduced in v4. From v4.2, numeric, boolean and date/time widgets are written as native values to spreadsheet formats (ODS, XLS, XLSX). This was the default behavior in v3. See documentation.\n\nThis means that the coerce_to_string value which is passed to Widget is now ignored if you are exporting to a spreadsheet format from the Admin interface.\n\nIf you have subclassed Widget, Field or Resource, then you may need to adjust your code to include the **kwargs param as follows:\n\nWidget.render(self, value, obj=None)\n\nWidget.render(self, value, obj=None, **kwargs)\n\nField.export(self, instance)\n\nField.export(self, instance, **kwargs)\n\nResource.export_field(self, field, instance)\n\nResource.export_field(self, field, instance, **kwargs)\n\nResource.export_resource(self, instance, selected_fields=None)\n\nResource.export_resource(self, instance, selected_fields=None, **kwargs)\n\nThe Resource.get_fields() method is no longer called within the package and has been deprecated. If you have overridden this method then it should be removed.\n\nv4 introduces significant updates to import-export. We have taken the opportunity to introduce breaking changes in order to fix some long-standing issues.\n\nRefer to the changelog for more information. Please ensure you test thoroughly before deploying v4 to production.\n\nThis guide describes the major changes and how to upgrade.\n\nWe have modified installation methods to allow for optional dependencies. This means that you have to explicitly declare dependencies when installing import-export.\n\nIf you are not sure, or want to preserve the pre-v4 behaviour, then ensure that import-export is installed as follows (either in your requirements file or during installation):\n\nConstructor arguments are dynamically set during instantiation based on the properties of the underlying Django db CharField. If the db field has blank set to True, then incoming values of empty strings or null are stored as empty strings. See CharWidget.\n\nclean() will now return a string type as the default. The coerce_to_string option introduced in v3 is no longer used in this method.\n\nThe following widgets have had validation error messages updated:\n\nWe have standardized the export output which is returned from render().\n\nPrior to v4, the export format returned from render() varied between Widget implementations. In v4, return values are rendered as strings by default (where applicable), with None values returned as empty strings. Widget params can modify this behavior.\n\nThis causes a change when exporting to Excel. In v3, certain fields, such as numeric values, were rendered as their native type. In v4, all fields are now rendered as strings. To preserve the v3 behavior when exporting to Excel, set the coerce_to_string param to False. See documentation.\n\nWidget API documentation.\n\nThe ordering rules for exported fields has been standardized. See documentation.\n\nIf the raise_errors parameter of import_data() is True, then an instance of ImportError is raised. This exception wraps the underlying exception.\n\nPrior to v4 we had numerous issues where users were confused when imports failed due to declared import_id_fields not being present in the dataset. We added functionality in v4 to check for this and to raise a clearer error message.\n\nIn some use-cases, it is a requirement that import_id_fields are not in the dataset, and are generated dynamically. If this affects your implementation, start with the documentation here.\n\nThe obj param passed to render() is deprecated. The render() method should not need to have a reference to model instance. The call to render() from export() has been removed.\n\nUse of ExportViewFormMixin is deprecated. See this issue.\n\nIn the Admin UI, the declaration of resource_class is replaced by resource_classes:\n\nLogEntry instances are created during import for creates, updates and deletes. The functionality to store LogEntry has changed in v4 in order to address a deprecation in Django 5. For this to work correctly, deleted instances are now always copied and retained in each RowResult so that they can be recorded in each LogEntry.\n\nThis only occurs for delete operations initiated from the Admin UI.\n\nThe export action has been updated to include the export workflow. Prior to v4, it was possible to select export selected items using an export admin action. However this meant that the export workflow was skipped and it was not possible to select the export resource. This has been fixed in v4 so that export workflow is now present when exporting via the Admin UI action. For more information see export documentation.\n\nThe export ‘confirm’ page now includes selectable fields for export. If you wish to revert to the previous (v3) version of the export confirm screen, add a export_form_class declaration to your Admin class subclass, for example:\n\nThe success message shown on successful import has been updated to include the number of ‘deleted’ and ‘skipped’ rows. See this PR.\n\nThe default error message for import errors has been modified to simplify the format. Error messages now contain the error message only by default. The row and traceback are not presented.\n\nThe original format can be restored by setting import_error_display on the Admin class definition. For example:\n\nv4 of import-export contains a number of changes to the API. These changes are summarized in the table below. Refer to this PR for detailed information.\n\nIf you have customized import-export by overriding methods, then you may have to modify your installation before working with v4.\n\nIf you have not overridden any methods then you should not be affected by these changes and no changes to your code should be necessary.\n\nThe API changes include changes to method arguments, although some method names have changed.\n\nMethods which process row data have been updated so that method args are standardized. This has been done to resolve inconsistency issues where the parameters differed between method calls, and to allow easier extensibility.\n\nimport_obj(self, obj, data, dry_run,

      "description": "Release Notes v5.0 Breaking changes This release fixes an issue with form field name clashes (see 2108). If you have any customizations which rely on form field names then you may need to make some adjustments as a result of this change. The resource, format and export_items field names are now prepended with django-import-export-. Removed the deprecated get_valid_export_item_pks() method in favour of get_queryset(). Use the ModelAdmin’s get_queryset() or get_export_queryset() instead. See PR 1890. Fixed issue where export forms were incorrectly showing import fields instead of export fields. This was resolved by introducing context-specific methods for field retrieval. See deprecations and PR 2118. Deprecations The get_user_visible_fields() method is now deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0. Use get_user_visible_import_fields() for import contexts and get_user_visible_export_fields() for export contexts instead. This change ensures that import and export operations show their respective field sets correctly in admin forms. v4.2 When exporting via admin action, the queryset is now filtered on get_queryset() instead of the Model’s default queryset. This should have no impact on existing implementations. This change also made get_valid_export_item_pks() obsolete, as the ModelAdmin’s get_export_queryset(), or ModelAdmin’s get_queryset can be used instead. The get_valid_export_item_pks() method is now deprecated. See PR 1890. Removed internal method _get_enabled_export_fields() in favour of passing the selected fields list as a new parameter to export_resource() and get_export_headers(). Hide the “Resource” form when it only has one option, to avoid potentially confusing text in the interface like “Resource: BookResource”. To undo this change, use a form subclass that changes the field’s widget to a django.forms.Select. See 1908 tablib has been upgraded from v3.5.0 to 3.6.1. This upgrade removes tablib’s dependency on MarkupPy in favour of ElementTree. If you export to HTML, then this change may affect your output format, particularly if you have already escaped HTML characters in the text. See issue 1627. Breaking changes This release fixes a regression introduced in v4. From v4.2, numeric, boolean and date/time widgets are written as native values to spreadsheet formats (ODS, XLS, XLSX). This was the default behavior in v3. See documentation. This means that the coerce_to_string value which is passed to Widget is now ignored if you are exporting to a spreadsheet format from the Admin interface. If you have subclassed Widget, Field or Resource, then you may need to adjust your code to include the **kwargs param as follows: Previous New Widget.render(self, value, obj=None) Widget.render(self, value, obj=None, **kwargs) Field.export(self, instance) Field.export(self, instance, **kwargs) Resource.export_field(self, field, instance) Resource.export_field(self, field, instance, **kwargs) Resource.export_resource(self, instance, selected_fields=None) Resource.export_resource(self, instance, selected_fields=None, **kwargs) v4.1 The Resource.get_fields() method is no longer called within the package and has been deprecated. If you have overridden this method then it should be removed. v4.0 v4 introduces significant updates to import-export. We have taken the opportunity to introduce breaking changes in order to fix some long-standing issues. Refer to the changelog for more information. Please ensure you test thoroughly before deploying v4 to production. This guide describes the major changes and how to upgrade. Installation We have modified installation methods to allow for optional dependencies. This means that you have to explicitly declare dependencies when installing import-export. If you are not sure, or want to preserve the pre-v4 behaviour, then ensure that import-export is installed as follows (either in your requirements file or during installation): django-import-export[all] Functional changes CharWidget Constructor arguments are dynamically set during instantiation based on the properties of the underlying Django db CharField. If the db field has blank set to True, then incoming values of empty strings or null are stored as empty strings. See CharWidget. clean() will now return a string type as the default. The coerce_to_string option introduced in v3 is no longer used in this method. Validation error messages The following widgets have had validation error messages updated: DateWidget TimeWidget DateTimeWidget DurationWidget Export format We have standardized the export output which is returned from render(). Prior to v4, the export format returned from render() varied between Widget implementations. In v4, return values are rendered as strings by default (where applicable), with None values returned as empty strings. Widget params can modify this behavior. This causes a change when exporting to Excel. In v3, certain fields, such as numeric values, were rendered as their native type. In v4, all fields are now rendered as strings. To preserve the v3 behavior when exporting to Excel, set the coerce_to_string param to False. See documentation. Widget API documentation. Export field order The ordering rules for exported fields has been standardized. See documentation. Error output If the raise_errors parameter of import_data() is True, then an instance of ImportError is raised. This exception wraps the underlying exception. See this PR. Check import_id_fields Prior to v4 we had numerous issues where users were confused when imports failed due to declared import_id_fields not being present in the dataset. We added functionality in v4 to check for this and to raise a clearer error message. In some use-cases, it is a requirement that import_id_fields are not in the dataset, and are generated dynamically. If this affects your implementation, start with the documentation here. Deprecations The obj param passed to render() is deprecated. The render() method should not need to have a reference to model instance. The call to render() from export() has been removed. Use of ExportViewFormMixin is deprecated. See this issue. See Renamed methods. In the Admin UI, the declaration of resource_class is replaced by resource_classes: class BookAdmin(ImportExportModelAdmin): # remove this line # resource_class = BookResource # replace with this resource_classes = [BookResource] Admin UI LogEntry LogEntry instances are created during import for creates, updates and deletes. The functionality to store LogEntry has changed in v4 in order to address a deprecation in Django 5. For this to work correctly, deleted instances are now always copied and retained in each RowResult so that they can be recorded in each LogEntry. This only occurs for delete operations initiated from the Admin UI. Export action The export action has been updated to include the export workflow. Prior to v4, it was possible to select export selected items using an export admin action. However this meant that the export workflow was skipped and it was not possible to select the export resource. This has been fixed in v4 so that export workflow is now present when exporting via the Admin UI action. For more information see export documentation. Export selected fields The export ‘confirm’ page now includes selectable fields for export. If you wish to revert to the previous (v3) version of the export confirm screen, add a export_form_class declaration to your Admin class subclass, for example: class BookAdmin(ImportExportModelAdmin): export_form_class = ExportForm Success message The success message shown on successful import has been updated to include the number of ‘deleted’ and ‘skipped’ rows. See this PR. Import error messages The default error message for import errors has been modified to simplify the format. Error messages now contain the error message only by default. The row and traceback are not presented. The original format can be restored by setting import_error_display on the Admin class definition. For example: class BookAdmin(ImportExportModelAdmin): import_error_display = (\"message\", \"row\", \"traceback\") See this issue. API changes v4 of import-export contains a number of changes to the API. These changes are summarized in the table below. Refer to this PR for detailed information. If you have customized import-export by overriding methods, then you may have to modify your installation before working with v4. If you have not overridden any methods then you should not be affected by these changes and no changes to your code should be necessary. The API changes include changes to method arguments, although some method names have changed. Methods which process row data have been updated so that method args are standardized. This has been done to resolve inconsistency issues where the parameters differed between method calls, and to allow easier extensibility. import_export.resources.Resource Renamed methods Previous New Summary import_obj(self, obj, data, dry_run, **kwargs) import_instance(self, instance, row, **kwargs) obj param renamed to instance data param renamed to row dry_run param now in kwargs after_import_instance(self, instance, new, row_number=None, **kwargs) after_init_instance(self, instance, new, row, **kwargs) row added as mandatory arg row_number now in kwargs Parameter changes This section describes methods in which the parameters have changed.
