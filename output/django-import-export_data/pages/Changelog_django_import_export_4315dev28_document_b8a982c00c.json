If you have overridden any methods from the resources or widgets modules, you may need to update your implementation to accommodate these changes.\n\nThis fixes an issue where ManyToMany fields are not checked correctly in skip_row(). This means that skip_row() now takes row as a mandatory arg. If you have overridden skip_row() in your own implementation, you will need to add row as an arg.\n\nIf you have overridden skip_row() you can choose whether or not to skip rows if validation errors are present. The default behavior is to not to skip rows if there are validation errors during import.\n\nimport_export.resources.save_instance() now takes an additional mandatory argument: is_create. If you have overridden save_instance() in your own code, you will need to add this new argument.\n\nIf you have overridden clean() then you should update your method definition to reflect this change.\n\nwidgets.ForeignKeyWidget / widgets.ManyToManyWidget: The unused *args param has been removed from __init__(). If you have overridden ForeignKeyWidget or ManyToManyWidget you may need to update your implementation to reflect this change.\n\nExceptions raised during the import process are now presented as form errors, instead of being wrapped in a <H1> tag in the response. If you have any custom logic which uses the error written directly into the response, then this may need to be changed.\n\nPrevious ImportForm implementation was based on Django’s forms.Form, if you have any custom ImportForm you now need to inherit from import_export.forms.ImportExportFormBase.\n\nIf you are using admin mixins from this library in conjunction with code that overrides change_list_template (typically admin mixins from other libraries such as django-admin-sortable2 or reversion), object tools in the admin change list views may render differently now.\n\nIf you have created a custom template which extends any import_export template, then this may now cause a recursion error (see `1415 <https://github.com/django-import-export/django-import-export/pull/1415 >`_)\n\nIf you have made customizations to the import template then you may need to refactor these after the addition of block declarations.\n\nThis release adds some deprecations which will be removed in a future release.\n\nAdd support for multiple resources in ModelAdmin. (1223)\n\nThe *Mixin.resource_class accepting single resource has been deprecated and the new *Mixin.resource_classes accepting subscriptable type (list, tuple, …) has been added.\n\nSame applies to all of the get_resource_class, get_import_resource_class and get_export_resource_class methods.\n\nDeprecated exceptions.py (1372)\n\nRefactored form-related methods on ImportMixin / ExportMixin (1147)\n\nThe following are deprecated:\n\nget_confirm_import_form()\n\nDefault format selections set correctly for export action (1389)\n\nAdded option to store raw row values in each row’s RowResult (1393)\n\nAdd natural key support to ForeignKeyWidget (1371)\n\nOptimised default instantiation of CharWidget (1414)\n\nAllow custom change_list_template in admin views using mixins (1483)\n\nAdded blocks to import template (1488)\n\nimprove compatibility with previous ImportForm signature (1434)\n\nRefactored form-related methods on ImportMixin / ExportMixin (1147)\n\nInclude custom form media in templates (1038)\n\nRemove unnecessary files generated when running tox locally (1426)\n\nFixed Makefile coverage: added coverage combine\n\nFixed handling of LF character when using CacheStorage (1417)\n\nbugfix: skip_row() handles M2M field when UUID pk used\n\nFix broken link to tablib formats page (1418)\n\nFix broken image ref in README.rst\n\nbugfix: skip_row() fix crash when model has m2m field and none is provided in upload (1439)\n\nFix deprecation in example application: Added support for transitional form renderer (1451)\n\nIncreased test coverage, refactored CI build to use tox (1372)\n\nClarified issues around the usage of temporary storage (1306)\n\nFix deprecation in example application: Added support for transitional form renderer (1451)\n\nEscape HTML output when rendering decoding errors (1469)\n\nApply make_aware when the original file contains actual datetimes (1478)\n\nAutomatically guess the format of the file when importing (1460)\n\nUpdated import.css to support dark mode (1318)\n\nFix crash when import_data() called with empty Dataset and collect_failed_rows=True (1381)\n\nImprove Korean translation (1402)\n\nUpdate example subclass widget code (1407)\n\nDrop support for python3.6, django 2.2, 3.0, 3.1 (1408)\n\nAdd get_export_form() to ExportMixin (1409)\n\nRemoved django_extensions from example app settings (1356)\n\nAdded support for Django 4.0 (1357)\n\nBig integer support for Integer widget (788)\n\nRun compilemessages command to keep .mo files in sync (1299)\n\nAdded skip_html_diff meta attribute (1329)\n\nAdded python3.10 to tox and CI environment list (1336)\n\nAdd ability to rollback the import on validation error (1339)\n\nFix missing migration on example app (1346)\n\nFix crash when deleting via admin site (1347)\n\nUse Github secret in CI script instead of hard-coded password (1348)\n\nDocumentation: correct error in example application which leads to crash (1353)\n\nRevert ‘dark mode’ css: causes issues in django2.2 (1330)\n\nAdded guard for null ‘options’ to fix crash (1325)\n\nUpdated import.css to support dark mode (1323)\n\nFixed regression where overridden mixin methods are not called (1315)\n\nFix xls/xlsx import of Time fields (1314)\n\nAdded support for ‘to_encoding’ attribute (1311)\n\nRemoved travis and replaced with github actions for CI (1307)\n\nIncreased test coverage (1286)\n\nFix minor date formatting issue for date with years < 1000 (1285)\n\nTranslate the zh_Hans missing part (1279)\n\nRemove code duplication from mixins.py and admin.py (1277)\n\nFix example in BooleanWidget docs (1276)\n\nBetter support for Django main (1272)\n\ndon’t test Django main branch with python36,37 (1269)\n\nSupport Django 3.2 (1265)\n\nCorrect typo in Readme (1258)\n\nRephrase logical clauses in docstrings (1255)\n\nSupport multiple databases (1254)\n\nUpdate django master to django main (1251)\n\nAdd Farsi translated messages in the locale (1249)\n\nUpdate Russian translations (1244)\n\nAppend export admin action using ModelAdmin.get_actions (1241)\n\nFix minor mistake in makemigrations command (1233)\n\nRemove EOL Python 3.5 from CI (1228)\n\nCachedInstanceLoader defaults to empty when import_id is missing (1225)\n\nAdd kwargs to import_row, import_object and import_field (1190)\n\nCall load_workbook() with data_only flag (1095)\n\nChanged the default value for IMPORT_EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE to 100.
