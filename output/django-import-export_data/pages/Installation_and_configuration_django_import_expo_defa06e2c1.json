  "title": "Installation and configuration — django-import-export 4.3.15.dev28 documentation",
  "content": "import-export is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so it can be installed with standard Python tools like pip or easy_install:\n\nThis will automatically install the default formats supported by tablib. If you need additional formats you should install the extra dependencies as required appropriate tablib dependencies (e.g. pip install django-import-export[xlsx]).\n\nTo install all available formats, use pip install django-import-export[all].\n\nFor all formats, see the tablib documentation.\n\nAlternatively, you can install the git repository directly to obtain the development version:\n\nNow, you’re good to go, unless you want to use import-export from the admin as well. In this case, you need to add it to your INSTALLED_APPS and let Django collect its static files.\n\nAll prerequisites are set up! See Getting started to learn how to use import-export in your project.\n\nYou can configure the following in your settings file:\n\nControls if resource importing should use database transactions. Defaults to True. Using transactions makes imports safer as a failure during import won’t import only part of the data set.\n\nCan be overridden on a Resource class by setting the use_transactions class attribute.\n\nIf set to True, skips the creation of admin log entries when importing via the Admin UI. Defaults to False. This can speed up importing large data sets, at the cost of losing an audit trail.\n\nCan be overridden on a ModelAdmin class inheriting from ImportMixin by setting the skip_admin_log class attribute.\n\nA string path to the preferred temporary storage module.\n\nControls which storage class to use for storing the temporary uploaded file during imports. Defaults to import_export.tmp_storages.TempFolderStorage.\n\nCan be overridden on a ModelAdmin class inheriting from ImportMixin by setting the tmp_storage_class class attribute.\n\nA string path to a customized storage implementation.\n\nThis setting is deprecated and only applies if using Django with a version less than 4.2, and will be removed in a future release.\n\nIf set, lists the permission code that is required for users to perform the ‘import’ action. Defaults to None, which means all users can perform imports.\n\nDjango’s built-in permissions have the codes add, change, delete, and view. You can also add your own permissions. For example, if you set this value to ‘import’, then you can define an explicit permission for import in the example app with:\n\nNow only users who are assigned ‘import_book’ permission will be able to perform imports. For more information refer to the Django auth documentation.\n\nDefines the same behaviour as IMPORT_EXPORT_IMPORT_PERMISSION_CODE, but for export.\n\nAn integer that defines the size of chunks when iterating a QuerySet for data exports. Defaults to 100. You may be able to save memory usage by decreasing it, or speed up exports by increasing it.\n\nCan be overridden on a Resource class by setting the chunk_size class attribute.\n\nIf True, no import confirmation page will be presented to the user in the Admin UI. The file will be imported in a single step.\n\nBy default, the import will occur in a transaction. If the import causes any runtime errors (including validation errors), then the errors are presented to the user and then entire transaction is rolled back.\n\nNote that if you disable transaction support via configuration (or if your database does not support transactions), then validation errors will still be presented to the user but valid rows will have imported.\n\nThis flag can be enabled for the model admin using the skip_import_confirm flag.\n\nA boolean value which will skip the export form in the Admin UI, when the export is initiated from the change list page. The file will be exported in a single step.\n\nthe first element in the resource_classes list will be used.\n\nthe first element in the EXPORT_FORMATS list will be used.\n\nThis flag can be enabled for the model admin using the skip_export_form flag.\n\nA boolean value which will skip the export form in the Admin UI, but only when the export is requested from an Admin UI action, or from the ‘Export’ button on the change form.\n\nSee also IMPORT_EXPORT_SKIP_ADMIN_EXPORT_UI.\n\nThis flag can be enabled for the model admin using the skip_export_form_from_action flag.\n\nIf set to True, strings will be sanitized by removing any leading ‘=’ character. This is to prevent execution of Excel formulae. By default this is False.\n\nIf an export to XLSX format generates IllegalCharacterError, then if this flag is True strings will be sanitized by removing any invalid Excel characters, replacing them with the unicode replacement character. By default this is False, meaning that IllegalCharacterError is caught and re-raised as ValueError.\n\nA list that defines which file formats will be allowed during imports and exports. Defaults to import_export.formats.base_formats.DEFAULT_FORMATS. The values must be those provided in import_export.formats.base_formats e.g\n\nThis can be set for a specific model admin by declaring the formats attribute.\n\nA list that defines which file formats will be allowed during imports. Defaults to IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS. The values must be those provided in import_export.formats.base_formats e.g\n\nThis can be set for a specific model admin by declaring the import_formats attribute.\n\nA list that defines which file formats will be allowed during exports. Defaults to IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS. The values must be those provided in import_export.formats.base_formats e.g\n\nThis can be set for a specific model admin by declaring the export_formats attribute.\n\nIf set to True, rows without content will be ignored in XSLX imports. This prevents an old Excel 1.0 bug which causes openpyxl max_rows to be counting all logical empty rows. Some editors (like LibreOffice) might add \\(2^{20}\\) empty rows to the file, which causes a significant slowdown. By default this is False.\n\nThere’s an example application that showcases what import_export can do.\n\nBefore starting, set up a virtual environment (“venv”) using these instructions.\n\nYou can initialize and run the example application as follows:\n\nGo to http://127.0.0.1:8000\n\nFor example import files, see Test data.\n\nYou can adjust the log level to see output as required. This is an example configuration to be placed in your application settings:",
